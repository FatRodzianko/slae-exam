What does an egg hunter do?
It searches through memory of an application location for an "egg", or a sequence of bytes specifically chosen by the user and jumps to the address of the egg.

so you first
- insert your egg hunter shellcode as the first stage of the shellcode
- place the egg somewhere in memory
- place the shellcode you want to execute immediately after the egg as the second stage
