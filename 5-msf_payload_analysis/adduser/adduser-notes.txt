Looking at the shellcode for:
linux/x86/adduser

This should be adding a user with the name "metasploit" and a shell of /bin/sh

Looking at shellcode in libemu:
msfvenom --payload linux/x86/adduser -f raw | sctest -vvv -Ss 10000 -G adduser.dot

For some reason, libemu doesn't seem to show anything...

Moving onto gdb analysis
